## Implemented Injection Methods

We break the injection procedure into serveral "parts", and each part has a few selection of methods. For example, to access your target process, you can choose:

The UI should be quite self-explainary. You can select your injection target process by "drag and drop" a finder to the target's windows, just like the following
Then you select the injection method and click 'confirm'

+ Legitimate windows API, such as OpenProcess() and WriteProcessMemory()
+ Duplicating a existing handle to your target
+ Using a kernel module's assistant

Basic DLL loader (injector) for any game cheats, it will load the dll remotely from the server and inject it into the game using manual mapping (credit to Guidedhacking Broihon). Meaning the .dll (game hack) will never touch the hard drive. It'll go straight to memory.

 **AntiCheats that this injector is running**
 
* Vanguard
* Easy Anti Cheat
* BattlEye Anti Cheat
* FACEIT 
* Valve Anti-Cheat
* PunkBuster
* NProtect GameGuard
* Ricoche

## Why another dll injector?

I make this project just for fun, for learning .Net GUI development and for practicing many known dll inject technology.

##  Disclaimer
I also wanted to try out some Evasion Techniques. If you want a really secure cheat loader the code and logic should really be improved and you would have to add some features to secure it. I would advise you to create your own with the only goal to safely distribute your cheat. Check the link below if you really want to create your own and learn game hacking. (Btw I would not advise you to use SSL for a paycheat, no need to reinvent the wheel just use HTTPS). Anyway it will still work fine and provide very basic security features if you do not sell extremely expensive cheats and don't want to create your own. It's currently more like a dll injector than a loader
